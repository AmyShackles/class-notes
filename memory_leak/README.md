# Project Temporarily Suspended

### Been working on trying to come up with the cause of the leak for days now.  Going to attach screenshots taken of the Dominators view by Call Stack in Firefox DevTools.

#### New plan of attack will be to temporarily abandon this project in favor of starting a new Gatsby project from scratch to see if the problem exists in the Gatsby source files themselves or if it's coming from one of the plugins.
