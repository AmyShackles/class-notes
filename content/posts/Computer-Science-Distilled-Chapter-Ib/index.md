### Logic in Computing

Logic gates perform logic operations on electric current. Logic gates include NOT, AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, etc.

**Logic gates calculating 2 + 3 = 5 (10 + 11 = 101)**:

## 1.3 Counting

Both counting and logic belong in the field of _discrete mathematics_.

### Multiplying:

If one event happens _n_ ways and another _m_ ways, the way to calculate the number of ways both can happen is to multiply them.
