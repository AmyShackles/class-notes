### This is a repository for the application hosting a few of my class/book notes.

I hope to continue to port over notes from my other repository to this one in order to allow them to be available in a more readable format.

The application is currently available at: https://notes-for-great-good.netlify.com/

This application was made using https://github.com/justinformentin/gatsby-v2-tutorial-starter
